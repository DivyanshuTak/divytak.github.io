<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm a PhD student at the AIM lab at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital focused on developing deep learning models for healthcare applications with [Benjamin Kann, MD](https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/benjamin-h-kann) and [Dr. Hugo Aerts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v7G4QvIAAAAJ&hl=en) `. My work includes building generalized and tumor specific Brain MRI vision foundation models, and deep-learning brain tumor prognosis tools currently being used in clinical trials. I am currently working with [Dr. Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home?authuser=0) and [Dr. Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home?authuser=0) 

My research interests lie in computer vision, self-supervised learning, and vision-language alignment, with a focus on deployment in clinical settings. 

Before transitioning into healthcare AI, I worked on the development of the AI perception stack for autonomous driving with [Dr. Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home?authuser=0) at The Ohio State University. 

Outside of work, I love to play soccer and follow MMA.
